Dear Dr. and TA.,


	How are you I hope that you are in a good health. 

Here are some instructions that we made on our code, 1- You will find the calendar class attached and "Toggled" to not affect our code functions.
2- Do not forget to run the code, to add the external jars of library apache poi, and we attached the jars in the "lib" folder.
3- Do not forget to add the correct path of the excel sheet on your computer.
4- We changed the color of our GUI windows to be user-friendly, reshaped the buttons, and we apologize if we left any bad expectations.

Finally, thank you for your effort (the TA and Dr. Eman) for your great effort all over the semester.


Best Regards,
Team 7.
